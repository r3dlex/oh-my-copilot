# Skill: Interview

## Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | `interview` |
| **Keywords** | `interview:`, `/interview` |
| **Tier** | Planning Tool |
| **Source** | `src/skills/interview.mts` |

## Description

Conduct Socratic interviews to expose ambiguity and deepen understanding. Scores ambiguity across categories (Terminology, Scope, Process, Outcome) and surfaces remaining questions and next steps.

## Differentiation from deep-interview

| Aspect | interview | deep-interview |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Purpose** | General Socratic inquiry — expose ambiguity in any problem or plan | Pre-execution gating — mathematical ambiguity scoring before autonomous work begins |
| **Gating** | Does not block execution; produces a report | Gates entry into ralph/autopilot until score falls below threshold |
| **Trigger style** | On-demand, conversational | Pipeline step, usually auto-invoked before execution modes |
| **Output** | Structured interview report with ambiguity table | Pass/fail ambiguity gate + resolved requirements doc |

Use `interview` when you want a Socratic exploration of a topic. Use `deep-interview` when you need to gate autonomous execution until ambiguity is resolved.

## Interface

```typescript
interface SkillInput {
  trigger: string;
  args: string[];
}

interface SkillOutput {
  status: "ok" | "error";
  message: string;
}

export async function activate(input: SkillInput): Promise<SkillOutput>
export function deactivate(): void
```

## Implementation

Spawns `bin/omp.mjs interview [args]`. No persistent resources are maintained.

## When to Use

- Unclear requirements
- Complex problems
- Before major decisions
- Identifying blind spots
- Challenge assumptions

## Interview Process

### 1. Establish Context
- What is the problem?
- What do we think we know?
- What's the goal?

### 2. Probe Assumptions
- What are we assuming?
- Why are we assuming this?
- What if we're wrong?

### 3. Explore Evidence
- What evidence do we have?
- How strong is it?
- What's missing?

### 4. Test Alternatives
- What else could be true?
- What other explanations exist?
- What would disprove this?

### 5. Assess Uncertainty
- What don't we know?
- How confident are we?
- What would change our view?

## Question Types

### Clarifying
- "What do you mean by X?"
- "Can you give an example?"
- "How is this different from Y?"

### Assumption Probing
- "What are you assuming here?"
- "Why assume X rather than Y?"
- "What if that assumption is wrong?"

### Evidence Evaluation
- "What evidence supports this?"
- "How would we know if this is wrong?"
- "What's the strongest evidence?"

### Alternative Exploration
- "What other approaches exist?"
- "What would happen if we did X instead?"
- "What's the best alternative and why?"

### Implications Testing
- "If this is true, what else must be true?"
- "What would follow from this?"
- "What are the consequences?"

## Ambiguity Scoring

Rate ambiguity on scale:

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Clear | No ambiguity, single interpretation |
| 2 | Minor | Slight ambiguity, mostly clear |
| 3 | Moderate | Notable ambiguity, needs clarification |
| 4 | Significant | Major ambiguity, multiple interpretations |
| 5 | Severe | Fundamental ambiguity, needs resolution |

### Ambiguity Categories

**Terminology**
- Undefined terms
- Multiple meanings
- Jargon without explanation

**Scope**
- Boundary unclear
- Inclusion/exclusion fuzzy
- Overlap undefined

**Process**
- Steps missing
- Order ambiguous
- Responsibilities unclear

**Outcome**
- Success undefined
- Metrics absent
- Trade-offs unstated

## Output Format

```
## Interview: {topic}

### Opening Context
{what we discussed}

### Key Exchanges

#### Exchange 1: {subject}
**Q:** {question}
**A:** {answer}
**Ambiguity:** {score} - {notes}

#### Exchange 2: {subject}
...

### Assumptions Exposed
- **{assumption}** — {questioning}
- **{assumption}** — {questioning}

### Evidence Gaps
- **{gap}** — {what's missing}
- **{gap}** — {what's missing}

### Alternative Views
- **{alternative}** — {description}
- **{alternative}** — {description}

### Ambiguity Summary
| Category | Score | Key Issues |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Terminology | {n} | {issues} |
| Scope | {n} | {issues} |
| Process | {n} | {issues} |
| Outcome | {n} | {issues} |
| **Overall** | **{n}** | **{summary}** |

### Remaining Questions
1. {question}
2. {question}

### Next Steps
{how to resolve remaining ambiguity}
```

## Constraints

- Ask genuine questions
- Follow the thread
- Don't lead the witness
- Document all ambiguity
- Don't resolve prematurely
